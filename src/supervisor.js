// no longer seated. They go back to scheduled with no session, the way a
// restart leaves them, and the next clock tick rejoins every order still in
// its window on a worker that is up, with the stored room password. A
// meeting with no order (joined by hand with no password, or start_meeting)
// is marked reseat, and the same tick brings it back.
